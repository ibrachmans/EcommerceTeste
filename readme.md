<h1>E-COMMERCE MODEL WITH SEARCH AND PAGINATION</h1>

<h2>Why make this project?</h2>
This project was made as part of an interview process for Coteminas.

<h2>Technologies</h2>
I used NodeJs and NextJs as frameworks for backend and frontend respectively.
For the database i used SQLite.
I also made use of Typescript.

<h2>The challenge</h2>
This was my first FullStack project and was a real challenge for me, the
hardest part been the pagination, as i've never done anything like it before.

<h2>How to use it</h2>
To run this code you need an IDE to run the backend and frontend. You can run
the "yarn dev" commands on both backend and frontend folders and open the 
project on your localhost:3000.
